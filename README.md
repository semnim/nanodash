> a chrome extension tools built with Vite + React-ts, and Manifest v3

## Productivity fueling, fully interactive dashboard extension for Chrome.

## Motivation

Buying extensions is expensive and I know how to program, so I might rather build my own for free. 
I like using to-do apps, timers, and notes/reminders, those being the key features. I also love fully interactive applications, where i can drag and drop, 
style on the run, and don't need too many clicks.
## Features:
- Drag and drop to-do's with categorization
- Supports markdown
- Todo notes can be inlined - styled on the run
- Home screen fetching quotes, displaying time
- Todo: Reminders & notes
- Todo: Settings, customization by user (colors, images, ...)
